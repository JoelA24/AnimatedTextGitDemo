Part 1

1. git add branch <NAME>

2. Fast forward is when git can easily tell what commits happen when and puts them on top chronologically.
Recursive is the algorithm that occurs when Fast forward merge wont suffice.

3. git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>

4. git -d <BRANCH_NAME>
    - If a force is required use "-D" as opposed to "-d"

5. Merge conflicts occur when changes have occurred in both branches in the same file and git cant decide which to choose.
